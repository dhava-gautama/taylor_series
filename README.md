# Taylor Series
In mathematics, a Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function's derivatives at a single point. 

# Why Taylor Series Is Important?
* Calculate approximate values of almost every important function on calculators and computers
* Computing transcendental functions such as e^x, sinx, and cosx.
* Taylor series is used to expand the functions. For example you want to know the expansion of sin(x), you can use Taylor series to implement it.

## Require :
